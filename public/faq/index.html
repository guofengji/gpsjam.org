            <h2 id="what-exactly-does-this-map-show">What exactly does this map show?</h2>

            <p>
                Many aircraft broadcast information about how accurate their
                navigation system (which is almost always GPS) is at any given
                moment. The GPSJam map aggregates that data over 24 hours in
                time and displays it as a hexagonal map. Green hexagons show
                where more than 98% of all aircraft who flew through that area
                reported good navigation accuracy. Yellow hexagons show where
                between 2% and 10% of aircraft reported low navigation accuracy.
                Red hexagons show where more than 10% of aircraft reported low
                navigation accuracy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Areas where a significant percentage of aircraft report low
                navigation accuracy seem to correlate well with areas of known
                and suspected jamming activity.
            </p>

            <h2 id="what-is-the-source-of-your-data">Where does this data come from?</h2>

            <p>
                Many aircraft broadcast digital radio messages (ADS-B) that
                contain information about their GPS accuracy. <a href="https://adsbexchange.com">ADS-B Exchange</a> is a
                network
                of thousands of enthusiasts who receive those signals. I use the
                <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/data/">ADS-B Exchange
                    API</a> to collect and process the data and build maps from it.
            </p>

            <h2 id="is-it-just-gps">Is it just GPS? What about GLONASS, BeiDou,
                Galileo, and other GNSS?</h2>

            <p>
                The ADS-B data used by this map includes information on the
                <i>accuracy</i> of the navigation system used by each aircraft,
                but doesn't specify the <i>type</i> of navigation system. It
                could be GPS, another global navigation satellite system (GNSS)
                like GLONASS, or it could be an <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_navigation_system">inertial
                    navigation system (INS)</a>. My understanding is that most
                aircraft are using GPS, so that's probably mostly what the map
                shows.
            </p>

            <h2 id="is-it-always-jamming">Does red and yellow always mean there's jamming?</h2>
            <p>
                No. Red and yellow hexes show where a significant number of
                aircraft reported low navigation accuracy. This often seems to
                be in regions where it's known or suspected that GPS jamming is
                occurring, but the data doesn't tell me what's causing the low
                accuracy. See the <a href="#what-can-cause-aircraft-to-report-low-accuracy">next
                    question</a>.
            </p>

            <h2 id="what-can-cause-aircraft-to-report-low-accuracy">What can cause an aircraft to report low navigation
                accuracy?</h2>

            <p>
                Most aircraft with ADS-B are using GPS, and from what I can tell
                the most common reason for aircraft GPS systems to have degraded
                accuracy is jamming by military systems. At least, the vast
                majority of aircraft that I see with bad GPS accuracy are flying
                near conflict zones where GPS jamming is known to occur.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other causes of low GPS accuracy:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Testing of military jamming systems outside of conflict zones
                    (common in the southwestern United States)</li>
                <li>Jamming systems used to protect Russian oligarchs from drones</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="its-called-gpsjam">The site is called "GPSJam" but it might not be GPS or jamming?</h2>

            <p>
                That's right. The site is gpsjam.org, but the map might not show
                GPS nor jamming. I just think "gpsjam.org" sounds better than
                "potential-navigation-system-interference.org".
            </p>

            <h2 id="what-are-the-conflict-zones">What are the conflict zones where GPS jamming is regularly observed?
            </h2>

            <p>
                The conflict zones where I've most often observed GPS jamming
                include the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Much of the Middle East, especially including the eastern
                    Mediterranean. Iraq, Lebanon, Cyprus, Turkey, Armenia all
                    regularly see GPS jamming activity. In North Africa, Libya gets
                    some too.</li>
                <li>In Europe, Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Kaliningrad, and
                    Finland sometimes show presumed jamming activity.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2 id="what-time-zone">What time zone are the dates in?</h2>

            <p>
                UTC.
            </p>

            <h2 id="when-is-the-site-updated">When is the site updated with new data?</h2>

            <p>
                Every 24 hours, soon after midnight UTC.
            </p>

            <h2 id="i-live-in-one-of-the-red-zones">I live in one of the red zones and my GPS was fine?</h2>

            <p>
                The map is based on aircraft reports, and aircraft fly thousands
                of feet above the ground where they have line-of-sight to many
                more potential sources of GPS interference than you do on the
                ground. The map also aggregates a 24 hour period, so it's
                possible for interference to be present for a short time, still
                affect lots of aircraft and result in a region being colored
                red, but GPS was still fine for most of the day.
            </p>

            <h2 id="why-arent-there-red-or-green">Why aren't there red or green hexes on some parts of the map?</h2>

            <p>
                That's where there were either no aircraft flying with ADS-B
                (for example, in an active war zone) or there were no receivers
                feeding data to ADS-B Exchange.
            </p>

            <h2 id="whats-that-cool-background-image">What's that cool background image on some pages?</h2>

            <p>
                It's a map showing one day—March 5, 2022—of flights in the
                eastern Mediterranean, with each ADS-B position report color
                coded to show the navigation accuracy (NAC<sub>p</sub>, to be
                specific): High accuracy is blue and low accuracy is red.
