            <h2 id="what-exactly-does-this-map-show">What exactly does this map show?</h2>

            <p>Many aircraft broadcast information about how accurate their navigation
                system, which is almost always GPS, is at any given moment. The GPSJam map
                aggregates that data over 24 hours in time bins it into a hexagonal map.
                Green hexagons show where more than 98% of all aircraft who flew through
                that area reported good navigation accuracy. Yellow hexagons show where
                between 2% and 10% of aircraft reported low navigation accuracy. Red
                hexagons show where more than 10% of aircraft reported low navigation
                accuracy.</p>

            <p>Areas where a significant percentage of aircraft report low
                navigation accuracy seem to correlate well with areas of known and
                suspected jamming activity.</p>

            <h2 id="what-is-the-source-of-your-data">What is the source of your data?</h2>

            <p>Many aircraft broadcast digital radio messages (ADS-B) that contain
                information about their GPS accuracy. <a href="https://adsbexchange.com">ADS-B
                    Exchange</a> is a network of thousands of enthusiasts who receive those
                signals. I use the <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/data/">ADS-B
                    Exchange API</a> to collect and process the data and build maps from it.
            </p>

            <h2 id="is-it-just-gps">Is it just GPS? What about GLONASS, BeiDou, etc.?</h2>
            <p>Yes. GPS is the only navigation system that is widely used in aviation.
                GLONASS is a satellite system that is used in some areas of the world.
                BeiDou is a satellite system that is used in some areas of the world.
                Galileo is a satellite system that is used in some areas of the world.
                BeiDou and GLONASS are not used in the same areas as GPS.
            <h2 id="what-can-cause-aircraft-to-report-low-accuracy">What can cause an aircraft to report low navigation
                accuracy?</h2>

            <p>Most aircraft with ADS-B are using GPS, and from what I can tell the most
                common reason for aircraft GPS systems to have degraded accuracy is jamming
                by military systems. At least, the vast majority of aircraft that I see with
                bad GPS accuracy are flying near conflict zones where GPS jamming is known
                to occur.</p>

            <p>Other causes of low GPS accuracy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Testing of military jamming systems outside of conflict zones
                    (common in the southwestern United States)</li>
                <li>Jamming systems used to protect Russian oligarchs from drones</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="what-are-the-conflict-zones">What are the conflict zones where GPS jamming is regularly observed?
            </h2>

            <p>The conflict zones where I've most often observed GPS jamming include the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Much of the Middle East, especially including the eastern
                    Mediterranean. Iraq, Lebanon, Cyprus, Turkey, Armenia all regularly see
                    GPS jamming activity. In North Africa, Libya.</li>
                <li>In Europe, Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Kaliningrad, and
                    Finland sometimes show presumed jamming activity, depending on how
                    active Russia is.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2 id="what-time-zone">What time zone are the dates in?</h2>

            <p>UTC.</p>

            <h2 id="when-is-the-site-updated">When is the site updated with new data?</h2>

            <p>
                Every 24 hours, soon after midnight UTC.
            </p>

            <h2 id="i-live-in-one-of-the-red-zones">I live in one of the red zones and my GPS was fine?</h2>

            <p>
                The map is based on aircraft reports, and aircraft fly thousands of feet
                above the ground where they have line-of-sight to many more potential
                sources of GPS interference than you do on the ground. The map also
                aggregates a 24 hour period, so it's possible for interference to be
                present for a short time, still affect lots of aircraft and result in a
                region being colored red, but GPS was still fine for most of the day.
            </p>

            <h2 id="why-arent-there-red-or-green">Why aren't there red or green hexes on some parts of the map?</h2>

            <p>
                That's where there were either no aircraft flying with ADS-B
                (for example, in an active war zone) or there were no receivers
                feeding data to ADS-B Exchange.
